did a Git rebase, fixed the conflict and force pushed already, why it is still rebase mode, "dev|REBASE 2/3" ? how to exit it ? I don't want to throw away the rebase.

aaa@lenovo-pc MINGW64 ~/Documents/NetBeansProjects/GitTest1 (dev|REBASE 2/3)
$ git status
rebase in progress; onto f67f4c5
You are currently rebasing branch 'dev' on 'f67f4c5'.
  (all conflicts fixed: run "git rebase --continue")

nothing to commit, working tree clean

aaa@lenovo-pc MINGW64 ~/Documents/NetBeansProjects/GitTest1 (dev|REBASE 2/3)
$ git push --force origin dev
git@192.168.1.8's password:
Everything up-to-date
